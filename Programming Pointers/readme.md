# Understanding Pointers in C 

Welcome to  understanding pointers in the C programming language. 
Here, you'll find a basic introduction to pointers along with resources I used to help me understand this concept.

Pointers are variables that store memory addresses. They point to the location of other variables in memory. In C, pointers are used to directly manipulate memory and access arrays.
